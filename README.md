# Smart Gate Monitoring System(SGMS) - Final year Project üì±üéì
The Smart Gate Monitoring System is at the forefront of campus security, incorporating advanced technologies to ensure a safe and efficient environment. Leveraging the capabilities of Flutter for both mobile and web applications, and backed by Python and Flask for a robust backend, the system employs not one but two custom object detection models. These models, finely tuned to the specific requirements of the project, play a pivotal role in real-time surveillance and identification of vehicles, parking stickers, and license cards. This dual-object detection approach enhances the precision and reliability of the Smart Gate Monitoring System, making it a sophisticated and innovative solution for campus security needs.

# Technologies Used
**Flask :** Serves as the backend framework, handling HTTP requests and managing interactions with custom YOLO models for object detection and processing.

**Custom YOLO Models:** Integrated within the Flask backend to enable real-time object detection for license plates, parking stickers, and other key identifiers. These models have been finely tuned to meet the project's specific security requirements.

**Google Cloud Storage:** Used for storing, retrieving, and managing large datasets and model files, ensuring scalability and secure storage for the application‚Äôs data.

**Flutter with Dart:** Used for building a responsive and intuitive front-end experience across both iOS and Android devices. Flutter allows the app to deliver a consistent user experience on mobile and web platforms.

# Features üåü
The system boasts several exciting features, including:

* Verification of Malaysian license cars and extraction of relevant information.
* Detection of university parking stickers.
* Notification to security guard if car has no sticker.
* Easy-to-use app for scanning license cards and extracting information.
* Admin web panel for managing system settings and viewing reports.

# Project Details üë®‚Äçüíª
The Smart Gate Monitoring System is a project that I have developed with a passion for innovation and excellence. The system uses two custom object detection models(YOLO and SSD MobileNet), one for verifying Malaysian license cards to extract thier information, and the other one for detecting the university parking sticker.

To further enhance user experience and facilitate management, I've meticulously designed a user-friendly mobile app capable of seamless license card scanning. Additionally, an administrative web panel, thoughtfully crafted using the versatile Flutter framework, empowers users to configure the system settings and access insightful reports.
