# Smart Gate Monitoring System(SGMS) - Final year Project 📱🎓
Welcome to the Smart Gate Monitoring System , a state-of-the-art system developed as a final year project. The goal of the project is to design and implement a system to improve security and efficiency at the university gate. The system is developed as a Flutter app and web panel for the admin and uses two custom models to verify Malaysian license cars and detect the university parking sticker.

# Features 🌟
The system boasts several exciting features, including:

* Verification of Malaysian license cars and extraction of relevant information.
* Detection of university parking stickers.
* Notification to security guard if car has no sticker.
* Easy-to-use app for scanning license cards and extracting information.
* Admin web panel for managing system settings and viewing reports.

# Project Details 👨‍💻
The Smart Gate Monitoring System is a project that I have developed with a passion for innovation and excellence. The system uses two custom YOLO object detection models, one for verifying Malaysian license cards to extract thier information, and the other one for detecting the university parking sticker.
Witness the exceptional capabilities of our models in action through the captivating GIF below:

To further enhance user experience and facilitate management, I've meticulously designed a user-friendly mobile app capable of seamless license card scanning. Additionally, an administrative web panel, thoughtfully crafted using the versatile Flutter framework, empowers users to configure the system settings and access insightful reports.
